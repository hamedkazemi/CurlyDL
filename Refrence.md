### Workflow Examples

#### 1. Basic File Download

python

Copy code

`from download_sdk import DownloadManager

# Initialize the download manager
download_manager = DownloadManager()

# Start a download
download_id = download_manager.start_download(
    url='https://example.com/file.zip',
    output_path='/downloads/file.zip'
)

# Monitor progress
while not download_manager.is_complete(download_id):
    progress = download_manager.get_progress(download_id)
    print(f"Download progress: {progress}%")
    time.sleep(1)

# Verify checksum
checksum_valid = download_manager.verify_checksum(download_id, 'SHA256', expected_checksum)
if checksum_valid:
    print("Download completed and verified successfully.")
else:
    print("Checksum verification failed.")` 

#### 2. Resumable Download After Interruption

python

Copy code

`from download_sdk import DownloadManager

# Initialize the download manager
download_manager = DownloadManager()

# Resume a download using the same output path
download_id = download_manager.start_download(
    url='https://example.com/largefile.bin',
    output_path='/downloads/largefile.bin'
)

# The SDK will detect existing temporary files and resume the download` 

----------

### Data Structures and Storage

#### Temporary Files and Directories

-   **Structure**:
    
    -   `/downloads/largefile.bin` (final file)
    -   `/downloads/.largefile.bin_temp/` (temporary directory for segments and metadata)
        -   `segment_0.tmp`
        -   `segment_1.tmp`
        -   `...`
        -   `metadata.json`
-   **Metadata File** (`metadata.json`):
    
    -   Contains:
        -   Download URL
        -   Total file size
        -   Segment information (start byte, end byte, status)
        -   Checksums for each segment
        -   Download progress
        -   Timestamp of last update

#### Metadata Schema Example

json

Copy code

`{
    "url": "https://example.com/largefile.bin",
    "total_size": 1024000000,
    "segments": [
        {
            "index": 0,
            "start_byte": 0,
            "end_byte": 204799999,
            "status": "completed",
            "checksum": "abc123..."
        },
        {
            "index": 1,
            "start_byte": 204800000,
            "end_byte": 409599999,
            "status": "in_progress",
            "checksum": null
        }
        // More segments...
    ],
    "progress": 50.0,
    "last_updated": "2023-11-01T12:34:56Z"
}`
